### We distribute a source code and trained weight/bias for predicting pressure loss coefficient in a 90-degree bend.

#### For any kind of OS user, we provide a source code for loading trained weight and bias. 
#### The description of the source code is presented in the file named:  Load weight&bias_code_description_version 1.0.ipynb.
#### In the folder of 'Trained weight_bias_pressure loss coefficient_version 1.0', the source code of .py format and weight/bias files are uploaded.

#### In addition, we provide a trained artificial neural network (ANN) model as a program for ease use of our ANN model.

#### To run this program,  activate the file named 'Prediction of pressure loss coefficient of 90Â° bends.exe' and confirm the detailed information ReadMe.txt file.

#### If you provide reliable experimental or simulation data of the pressure loss coefficient in our e-mail (kanghw@chonnam.ac.kr), we will continuously distribute an updated ANN model for predicting the pressure loss coefficient.
